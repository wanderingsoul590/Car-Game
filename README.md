# Car-Game

To increase my jQuery and js skills I build this project.

in this project i create one ui where screen contain car clouds trees and road, 
after setuping all images it look like one single image and then i start writng js.

and add some funcnality like:
  -fill fuel
  -run car
  -stop car
  -reverce car
  -fuel miter
 
In the end, it turned out to be a really good project and it boosted my confidence a lot.
